        <ol>
        <ol>operating system: the software that controls the overall operation of a computer </ol>
        <ol>job queue: the jobs residing in a mass storage wait for execution</ol>
        <ol>FIFO: first in, first out </ol>
        <ol>interactive processing:operating systemd were developed that allowed a program being executed to carry on a dialogue with the user through remote termin</ol>
        <ol>time-sharing: operating systems thatprovided service to multiple users at the same time </ol>
        <ol>multiprogramming: the running of two or more programs or sequences of instructions simultaneously by a computer with more than one central processor </ol>
        <ol>application software:consist of the programs for performing tasks particular to the machine's utilization </ol>
        <ol>system software:performs those tasks that are common to computer systems in general. System Software provides the infrastructure that the application software requires, in much the same mannor as a nation's infrastructure  </ol>
        <ol>utility software:software units, programs for performing activities that are fundamental to computer installations but not included in the operating system</ol>
        <ol> graphical user interface (GUI):objects to be manipulated, such as files and programs, are represented pictorially on the display as icons </ol>
        <ol>shell:older user interfaces which communicated with users through textual messages using keyboard and montior screen</ol>
        <ol>kernel:the internal part of the operating system </ol>
        <ol>device driver:the software usits that communicate with the controllers to carry out operations on the peripheral devices attached to the machine  </ol>
        <ol>file manager: whoses job is coordinate the use of the machine's mass storage facilities </ol>  
        <ol>memory manager:is charged with the task of coordinating the machine's use of the main memory</ol>
        <ol>Virtual memory: fictional memory space created by paging</ol>
        <ol>boot strapping:performed by a computer each timeit is turned on. This procedure that transfers the operating system from the mass storage into main memory </ol>
        <ol>ROM: read only memory </ol>
        <ol>deadlock:the condition in which two or more processes are blocked from progressing because each is waiting for a resource that is allocated to another  </ol>
        <ol>spooling: holding data for output at a later but more convenient time </ol>
        <ol>super user (or administrator):the person who establish accounts </ol>system software:performs those tasks that are common to computer systems in general. System Software provides the infrastructure that the application software requires, in much the same mannor as a nation's infrastructure  </ol>
        <ol>multi-factor authentication:passwords, two factor authentication in which the user must provide a password and a special access code</ol>
