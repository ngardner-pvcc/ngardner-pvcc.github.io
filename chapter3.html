Chapter 3 Operating Systems Terminology
 operating system: the software that controls the overall operation of a computer 
job queue: the jobs residing in a mass storage wait for execution
 FIFO: first in, first out 
interactive processing:operating systemd were developed that allowed a program being executed to carry on a dialogue with the user through remote terminals 
time-sharing: operating systems thatprovided service to multiple users at the same time 
multiprogramming: the running of two or more programs or sequences of instructions simultaneously by a computer with more than one central processor 
application software:consist of the programs for performing tasks particular to the machine's utilization 
system software:performs those tasks that are common to computer systems in general. System Software provides the infrastructure that the application software requires, in much the same mannor as a nation's infrastructure 
utility software:software units, programs for performing activities that are fundamental to computer installations but not included in the operating system
 graphical user interface (GUI):objects to be manipulated, such as files and programs, are represented pictorially on the display as icons 
shell:older user interfaces which communicated with users through textual messages using keyboard and montior screen
 kernel:the internal part of the operating system 
device driver:the software usits that communicate with the controllers to carry out operations on the peripheral devices attached to the machine 
file manager: whoses job is coordinate the use of the machine's mass storage facilities
 memory manager:is charged with the task of coordinating the machine's use of the main memory 
Virtual memory: fictional memory space created by paging
 boot strapping:performed by a computer each timeit is turned on. This procedure that transfers the operating system from the mass storage into main memory
 ROM: read only memory 
deadlock:the condition in which two or more processes are blocked from progressing because each is waiting for a resource that is allocated to another 
spooling: holding data for output at a later but more convenient time
 super user (or administrator):the person who establish accounts 
multi-factor authentication:passwords, two factor authentication in which the user must provide a password and a special access code
